# Floating Point Adder in Verilog

This repository contains the implementation of a **32-bit IEEE 754 Floating Point Adder** written in Verilog. It performs addition of two single-precision floating point numbers, handling normalization, rounding, and special cases such as zero, infinity, and NaNs.

#Features

- IEEE 754 single-precision (32-bit) floating point support
- Handles normalization and denormalized numbers
- Supports addition of positive and negative numbers
- Manages edge cases:
  - Zero
  - Infinity
  - Not-a-Number (NaN)
  - Overflow and underflow conditions
